    "#### 1. Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "My preprocessing code consists of the following steps:\n",
    "* Equalize histogram in brightness channel (YUV) - makes sure every image has the same range of brightness, makes dark images more bright.\n",
    "* (Unsharp mask) - I tried to use this filter, but didn't get any significant improvement. It's probably due to the fact that:\n",
    "  * Convolutional layers can potentially build something similar to this, since this is just a smoothing kernel followed by a subtraction\n",
    "  * Validation set accuracy was already about 99.2% when I was implementing this, which means the network only makes around 35 mistakes in 4410 images - at this point it might be just not sensitive enough to do any further improvements. I would need a bigger validation set to find improvements in the remaining 1% of accuracy score.\n",
    "* Convert to grayscale - I think this step could actually be done by a 1x1 convolution layer, but didn't get it to work in practice; also, normalization in grayscale has a nice effect of keeping every image visually understandable, which helps to visualize network activations.\n",
    "* Subtract mean - makes sure pixel values are centered at 0 for every image.\n",
    "* Divide by std. dev. - makes sure pixel values have a standard deviation of 1 for every image.\n",
    "\n",
    "![preprocessing steps](./writeup/preprocessing-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to generate additional data because of two reasons:\n",
    "* The initial network seemed to easily overfit the training dataset, so I assumed having a bigger dataset will help avoid overfitting.\n",
    "* Some of the sign classes have very few examples; generating more images can help improve detecting those classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add more data to the the data set, I used the following techniques:\n",
    "* Rotating by a random angle between -13 and 13 degrees\n",
    "* Scaling between 0.9 and 1.1\n",
    "* Translating between -2 and 2 pixels in both X and Y directions\n",
    "* Scaling on individual axis between 0.8 and 1.2\n",
    "\n",
    "While implementing this, I was constantly making sure the result still looks like images from the dataset.\n",
    "I had an interesting problem here when I applied each of these transformations separately using cv2.warpAffine. When I realized that doing this loses a lot of image quality due to pixel interpolation, I replaced it with building a transformation matrix and doing cv2.warpAffine once, instantly getting from 98% to 99% validation set accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the images are standardized before augmentation, I assume that it's safe to pad new images with 0s when they are made smaller or rotated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of an original image (top left) and 10 augmented images:\n",
    "\n",
    "![augmentation](./writeup/augmentation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the original data set and the augmented data set is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each original image is duplicated so that the ratio between original images and new images is kept to 1:5.\n",
    "* 10 random copies of the original image are added to the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the size of the training set goes up from 34799 to 12 x 34799 = 417588 images."
